# 🌌 QuantumShield Swarm

> *QuantumShield Swarm is an autonomous swarm of AI agents that continuously detects, predicts, and proves PCI/PII compliance for a Visa-like global payment network using agentic AI, quantum-inspired intelligence, and privacy-preserving proofs.*

---

## 🧠 The Problem
Companies in the payments ecosystem handle billions of transactions and extremely sensitive data while navigating complex, changing regulations. Current compliance systems are manual, reactive, and hard to audit, leading to breaches and fines.

## 💡 The Solution
**QuantumShield Swarm** acting as a living, intelligent security layer. It thinks, watches, predicts, fixes, and proves compliance automatically.

## 🐝 Why "Swarm"?
Usage of multiple autonomous agents, each with a specific role:
- **Lawyer Agent**: Regulation Intelligence
- **Auditor Agent**: Real-Time Monitoring
- **Predictor Agent**: Compliance Risk Forecasting
- **Fixer Agent**: Zero-Touch Remediation
- **Boss Agent**: Swarm Orchestrator

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Quantum-Inspired Intelligence**: Resolves complex conflicts between overlapping regulations.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Proves compliance without revealing sensitive data.
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: Tamper-proof evidence on a blockchain concept.

## 🏆 Benefits
- Prevents fines before they happen.
- Reduces manual work by **70-90%**.
- Scales globally.
- Future-ready for quantum-era threats.
